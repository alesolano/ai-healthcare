From Lesson 1

**Specificity**: TN / (TN + FP)
Proportion of accurately identified negative cases

**Sensitivity**: TP / (TP + FN)
Proportion of accurately identified positive cases
Also commonly referred as **true positive rate** or **recall**.

**Precision**: TP / (TP + FP)
From all the positives that I say, just trust this percentage
Also commonly referred as **positive predictive value**
